&emsp;I am currently affiliated with MBZUAI, where I conduct research under the supervision of Prof. [Xiuying Chen](https://iriscxy.github.io/) and Prof. [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/). Additionally, I have been fortunate to collaborate with several outstanding researchers, such as Prof. [Dongsheng Luo](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~dluo/) from Florida International University, Prof. [Yifan Chen](https://ychen-stat-ml.github.io/) from Hong Kong Baptist University, and Prof. [Shangsong Liang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LiangShangsong) from Sun Yat-sen University.

&emsp;I earned my bachelor’s degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at South China University of Technology and had a rewarding research experience at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests lie broadly in **Signal Processing & Information Theory**, with a particular focus on Geometric & Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and its real-world applications such as Anomaly Detection and Scene Graph Generation. Recently, I began to pay my attention to LLM for Scientific Discovery & Symbolic Regression.  

### **I am seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in 2025/2026. Also, I am eager to collaborate on the intersection of graphs, signal processing theory, and LLMs. Feel free to drop me a mail, thanks :)**
