&emsp;**I am going to apply for MSc program in 2023 Fall**.  
&emsp;In the past, I obtained my bachelor's degree in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering from South China University of Technology in 2020. My research interest is broadly on deep learning with a focus on graph learning and its appilications in real world. Recently, I began focusing on Graph Signal Processing and Graph Generation (for Link Prediction).  
&emsp;I am keen on the research which has both rigor in mathematics and outperformed results in experiments, e.g. Variational Auto-Encoder. I think we should not only focus on empirical result, i.e., SOTA, but also care about the interpretation (at least, it must be intuitive).  
&emsp;In the rest time, I will play soccer with my friends. 


News
======
* A new submission to **ICML2023**.  
* A new submission about 3D-Vision.  
* I am now in my 3rd (remote) research internship with [Dr.Dongsheng Luo](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~dluo/). I am concentrated on a problem about ***denoising in both graph structure and graph signal***.
