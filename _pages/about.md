I am now a student in Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my bachelor's degree in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering from South China University of Technology in 2020. My research interest is broadly on deep learning with a focus on graph learning and its appilications in real world. Recently, I began focusing on Graph Signal Processing and Graph Generation (for Link Prediction).
I am keen on the research which has both rigor in mathematics and outperformed results in experiments, e.g. Variational Auto-Encoder. I think we should not only focus on empirical result, i.e., SOTA, but also care about the interpretation (at least, it must be inductive or intuitive).  
In the rest time, I will play soccer with my friends.
