I am now a first-year master student in Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my bachelor's degree in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering from South China University of Technology in 2020. My research interest is broadly on deep learning with a focus on graph learning and its appilications in real world. I am keen on the research which has both rigor in mathematics and outperformed results in experiments, e.g. Variational Auto-Encoder. In rest time, I often play soccer with my friends.
