&emsp;I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at South China University of Technology. My research interests lie broadly in **Signal Processing & Information Theory**, with a particular focus on Geometric and Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and its real-world applications such as Anomaly Detection and Scene Graph Generation. Recently, I began to pay my attention to LLM for Scientific Discovery & Symbolic Regression.
