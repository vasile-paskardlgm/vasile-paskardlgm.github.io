&emsp;I am interning at Tencent & HKUST-GZ, where I will conduct research under the guidance of Prof. [Menglin Yang](https://yangmenglinsite.github.io/) and [Junwei Pan](https://junwei-pan.github.io/). I was previously affiliated with MBZUAI, advised by Prof. [Xiuying Chen](https://iriscxy.github.io/) (MBZUAI), Prof. [Shangsong Liang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LiangShangsong) (Sun Yat-sen University), and Prof. [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) (MBZUAI & CMU). Additionally, I have been fortunate to collaborate with several outstanding researchers, including Prof. [Dongsheng Luo](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~dluo/) (Florida International University) and Prof. [Yifan Chen](https://ychen-stat-ml.github.io/) (Hong Kong Baptist University).

&emsp;I earned my bachelor’s degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at South China University of Technology (华南理工大学, SCUT) and had a rewarding research experience at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests broadly center on **Scalability** in **Machine Learning**, **Signal Processing** and **Information Theory**, with a particular focus on **Geometric & Graph-structured Data**. I also explore their implications for applications such as Graph Anomaly Detection and Scene Graph Generation. Recently, I began to pay my attention to LLM for Scientific Discovery.  

### **I am seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in 2025/2026. Also, I am eager to collaborate on the intersection of graphs, signal processing, and LLMs. Feel free to drop me a mail, thanks :)**
