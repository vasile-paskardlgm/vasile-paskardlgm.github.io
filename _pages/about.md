&emsp;In the past, I obtained my bachelor's degree in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering from South China University of Technology. My research interest is broadly on deep learning with a focus on Geometric / Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and its appilications in real world.  
&emsp;I am keen on the research which has both rigor in mathematics and outperformed results in experiments, such as, Variational Auto-Encoder, Spectral Graph Theory, and so on. 
&emsp;In the rest time, I often play soccer with my friends.
