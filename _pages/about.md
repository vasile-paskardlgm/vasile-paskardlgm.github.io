&emsp;In the past, I obtained my bachelor's degree in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering from South China University of Technology in 2020. My research interest is broadly on deep learning with a focus on Graph Signal Processing(GSP) and its appilications in real world.  
&emsp;I am keen on the research which has both rigor in mathematics and outperformed results in experiments, such as, Variational Auto-Encoder, Spectral Graph Theory, and so on. I think we should not only focus on empirical result, i.e., SOTA (~~yep, the most important thing of the paper~~), but also care about the interpretation (at least, it must be intuitive).  
&emsp;In the rest time, I will play soccer with my friends.
